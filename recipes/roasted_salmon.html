    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Moist and tender salmon with a slightly sweet and salty crust—it's the perfect bite! This recipe is easy and a nice choice to serve for guests who aren't used to eating salmon. Garnish with lemon slices and fresh parsley and serve alongside rice pilaf or roasted sweet potatoes. <br><br>
    
    Whole sides of salmon are very affordable and easy to find in most grocery stores.</p>

    <p>You can use honey, maple syrup, or brown sugar in place of molasses. And instead of Greek seasoning, you can use salt and pepper, jerk seasoning, or Cajun seasoning... whatever you like!</p><br><br>

        <li>nonstick cooking spray</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons molasses</li>
        <li>1 (2.5 pound) salmon fillet</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Greek seasoning (such as Cavender's®)</li>
        <li>1 medium lemon, juiced, divided</li>
    </ul><br><br>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
