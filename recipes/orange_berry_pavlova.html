    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul><h3> Pavlova Base: </h3>
        <li>6 egg whites, room temperature</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon almond extract</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons cornstarch</li><br><br>

        <h3>Orange Whipped Cream:</h3>
        <li>2 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>1 large orange, zested</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li><br><br>

        <h3>Topping:</h3>
        <li>1 large orange, peeled and sliced</li>
        <li>¾ cup mixed fresh berries</li>
    </ul><br><br>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Draw a 9-inch circle on a large sheet of parchment paper. Place parchment on a large baking sheet with the circle facing down and centered in the pan.</li><br>
        <li>Beat together egg whites, cream of tartar, and salt on high speed with an electric mixer in a bowl until soft peaks form. Add in sugar 1 tablespoon at a time, beating continuously, until stiff, glossy peaks form. Mix in vanilla and almond extracts. Sift cornstarch over the egg mixture and gently fold in until just combined.</li><br>
        <li>Pour egg mixture into the center of the circle on the parchment paper on the prepared pan. Starting from the center and moving outwards, gently form the meringue into a round no larger than the drawn circle. Create an impression in the center of the meringue so the edges are slightly taller than the middle.</li><br>
        <li>Place into the preheated oven and bake until the pavlova feels firm and dry to the touch, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Turn the oven off without removing pavlova. Leave in the oven to cool for at least 1 hour.</li><br>
        <li>Pour heavy whipping cream into a large bowl. Beat at medium-high speed until soft peaks form. Add orange zest and vanilla extract; beat until combined.</li><br>
        <li>Gently remove pavlova base from the parchment paper and place onto a serving tray. Top with whipped cream, oranges slices, and mixed berries. Serve immediately.</li>
